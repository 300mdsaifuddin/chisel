======= Fixes to Jonathan's Front-end ======
Remove type from node emission

Currently, these are not equivalent because we will fail a type check:
output in { input x : UInt, input y : UInt}
=>
input in {x : UInt, y : UInt}

Switch "input" -> "flip" and "output" to "" within a bundle
Switch "add-mod" -> "add-wrap"
Switch "multiplex" -> "mux"
Switch "greater" -> "gt"
