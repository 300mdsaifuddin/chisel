Functions (defn) have (1) a static type signature and (2) an implementation
You can define them seperately
  type signature -> defmulti
  implementation -> defmethod

Thus, you can have multiple defmethods per defmulti.
However, you cannot have:
  defmulti a(x:?) -> ?
  defn a(x:Int) -> Int
because it is unclear which to call (2 matching static type signatures)

TODO Implement resolve-kinds
TODO Read initialization spec
TODO Read through make-explicit-reset
TODO If you feel up for it, rewrite make-explicit-reset
TODO If you feel up for it, read through initialize-registers
TODO Look into testing framework

TODO 
Make stanza a git repo
Write Makefile
